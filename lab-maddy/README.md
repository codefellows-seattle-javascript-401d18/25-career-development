====
#### Project Description

- Read in an html file using the fs module
- parse that file form a string to an array of usable data
- push opening tags to a stack, and when we come across a closing tag we start popping things off the stack. We use the closing tags as a way to identify the next parent.
  - Using a stack we push opening tags until we encounter a closing tag
- Add the current tag to our tree using the surrounding data (recently popped or peeked tag) to the tree

- require in treeNode and stack
- require in fs and promisify

  INDEX.JS
  -
  ```javascript
   funciton htmlParser(filePath){
      fs.readFileProm(filePath)
      .then(fileBuff => fileBuff.toString().replace(/\s+/g), '') // in order to use this buffer data we pass in we need to stringify it. But it has white space becuase those are needed in unicode, so we have to use .replace(), then replace the white space with an actual space.
      .then(fileStr => fileStr.split('>'))//now that we have spaces we can split on the closing angle brackets
      //now we have an array of elements and text content- [<DOCTYPEhtml, <html, <p, </p, </html]
      //then determine if hte file is valid html (ex. does it have a DOCTYPE html?) we don't need that though because the <html becomes the root
      //then pass the array of elements into a helper called buildTree which takes the Tree constructor and the array as args. This is what builds the start of the tree...
      //then console.log the return value of the previous then block (ie- what does buildTree return?)
      // catch any errors generated by your helper functions


    //this is where we define all the helper functions
      //define buildTree here to accept Tree and Array of Elements as args
      function buildTree(tree, eleArray){
        //instantiate a stack
        //iterate of the eleArray
          //check if ele is an opening tag (use another helper function called "isOpeningTag")
          //if true
            //get the tag name and determine the parent node...Consider how to retrieve this piece. what could as a reference to that parent.
            //add the new Tree Node using the parent reference

          //return tree
      }

  }

  htmlParser(process.env.argv[2]){

  }
```

####  Documentation  
  * in your README, write documentation for you data structures

  * Code block usage examples:


  * Instructions for:
    * Installing and using your data structure:

    * Running any command line interface:

    * Accessing each method:

    * Running your tests:



## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
  <!-- list of files, configurations, tools, etc that are required -->
  Your lab directory must include  
  * [x]**README.md** -- with a documentation about your lab
  * [x]**.gitignore** -- with a robust .gitignore
  * [x]**.eslintrc** -- with the class .eslintrc file
  * [x]**.eslintignore** -- with the class .eslintignore
  * [x]**.package.json** -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies
  * [x]**lib/** -- directory for holding your programs helper modules
  * [x]**test/** -- directory for holding your programs unit and integration tests

#### Testing  
  * write at least three test assertions for each constructor method
  * organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability


#### Feature Tasks  
  1.  use the node fs module to read an HTML document into a buffer (minimal.html => found in the /assets dir)

  2.  parse the buffer and use the root `<html>` element, subsequent HTML tags, and their text content to build a tree data structure

    * hint: you will need to refactor your node to allow a different type of data to be stored in the `.value` property. The remainder of the node should not change
      * ```javascript
          Tree = Node {
            value: {
              eleName: 'xxx',
              textContent: 'yyy' (can be empty string??)
            },
              children: [{Node}, {Node}, ...]
            }
          }
        ```

#### From Scott:
- tree.test.js
```js
let TreeNode = require('./tree')
require('jest')

describe('Testing TreeNode', function() {
  test('should instantiate a new TreeNode', () => {
    expect('...')
  })

  test('should insert a new node into the tree', () => {
    let root = new TreeNode(1)
    expect(root.children.length).toBeFalsy()
    root.insert(new TreeNode(2), 1)
    expect(root.children.length).not.toBeFalsy()
    expect(root.children[0].val).toBe(2)
  })
})
```
