# Tree Lab
## Aka I have no idea how to get this buffer to not be html

Here's my idea about how to build it, although I didn't really get to 3. I don't know how to do anything with the pure html. Do I have to manually set up the tree by pulling things out of it? I'm just 1000% confused by this Lab

1. Read the doc into a buffer
2. Parse the buffer into a string
3. Somehow pick out the "root element", which is the <html> tag, which we will assign to be the first Tree Node - we have to convert it into a node too?
4. Make it then build the tree
